# Currency Converter

A very basic currency converter created for the purpose of learning some React.
It fetches the exchange rates from the API at https://ratesapi.io/.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
I didn't bother to add any CSS; I just wanted to play around with React.
So the app is hideous - sorry.

## Requirements

- Node.js v12+
- npm v6+

Useful:
 - React Developer Tools browser plugin

## Set-up

The project was created with the following command:
```
npx create-react-app converter
```
(This creates the folder and the basic project structure.)

Also [React Router](https://reactrouter.com/web) was installed:
```
npm install react-router-dom
```


To run the app, in the project folder:
```
npm start
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view the app in the browser.
